 Hi, I’m @Jiqbal1921.
 I am interested in discovering and characterizing exoplanets and brown dwarfs using the Transit Photometric method with ground-based and space-based telescopes data.  
 I am also interested in studying exoplanet atmospheres, demographics, and formation.
 I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to exoplanet transit analysis, atmospheric study, and astronomical data processing.
