 Hi, I’m @Jiqbal1921
 I’m interested in Exoplanetary science with a focus on exoplanet detection, their atmospheric characteristics, and habitability.  
 I’m currently learning advanced transit photometry techniques and atmospheric modeling.  
 I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to exoplanet transit analysis,atmospheric characteristics, and astronomical data processing.
